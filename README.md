# Triple-pendulum-model
 A triple pendulum consists of three rods of length L and mass m.
After defining the mass and the stiffness matrices, we can find the natural frequencies and the
mode shapes by getting the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of K and M matrix using function
called "eig". the steady state response is found by using the modal analysis.The forced response due to base excitation was also found.
